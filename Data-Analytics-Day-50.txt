 Advanced Data Analytics Lessons

🔹 Lesson 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
==========================================
Summary:
Raw data is messy. Cleaning ensures accuracy, consistency, and usability.
Remove duplicates
Handle missing values (mean/median imputation, drop rows)
Standardize formats (dates, phone numbers)
Normalize/scale numerical data

Example:
In a sales dataset, some rows have null in "Customer Age". Replace nulls with the average age or drop incomplete rows.


🔹 Lesson 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
=============================================
Summary:
EDA is the process of exploring data to discover trends, relationships, and anomalies before modeling.
Use summary stats (mean, median, mode)
Visualize with histograms, scatterplots, boxplots
Detect outliers

Example:
Netflix analyzing user watch-time:
Histogram → most users watch between 20–45 mins daily
Scatterplot → young users binge longer series


🔹 Lesson 3: Data Visualization
================================
Summary:
Turning numbers into visuals for insights. Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, Tableau.
Bar chart → categorical comparisons
Line chart → trends over time
Heatmap → correlations

Example:
Swiggy delivery times across cities shown in a bar chart → reveals Bangalore has the highest delays.


🔹 Lesson 4: Case Study – Sales Insights Dashboard
==============================================
Summary:
Combining all steps:
Clean raw sales data
Perform EDA to find sales patterns
Visualize monthly revenue in Power BI
Deliver insights (e.g., “December sales peak due to holiday offers”)

Example:
A retail store found weekend sales were 40% higher than weekdays. Action: Increase staffing and promotions on weekends.
